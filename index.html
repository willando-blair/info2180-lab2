        At the UWI Mona campus, the average undergraduate has a duration of 3 years. In other words, 3 years of not so much blood, but copious amounts of sweat and tears. Let's not forget the sleepless nights and the costly tuition.
        Imagine having gone through all the mental, physical and emotional turmoil of pursuing tertiary education and you end up at a BPO in a role so far from your area of study you hardly recognize yourself.
        They say that hardwork always pays off and to be honest it does, that is when there isn't someone else who's more hardworking at working against you. 
        What if after all this hardwork and all the sacrifices I find myself unemployed for an unsatisfactory amount of time with a plethora of qualifications?
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the reality for many university students post-graduation so why must I be exempted and not become a disappointing statistic. Now two years into my seemingly
        lucrative degree, I am faced with uncertainty as I soar full speed towards the end of my Bachelor's degree. Will my three years of suffering be invalidated by the 
        perception of my degree as mediocre? Will I be required to endure more suffering (higher education) to be deemed employable?

    <h2>Red Plate Takeover</h2>

        Jamaican taxis are the preferred mode of transportation for many "non-vehicle-owning" citizens like myself who want to get from point A to point B in an expedited travel time.
        Providing that there is always traffic on at least 5 major corporate area roadways on any given weekday, one might wonder how these taxis manage to get their passengers 
        from one parroquial extremity to the next in almost half the time taken by the average Joe. Let's just say the will of a taxi man is far stronger than any force I've
        witnessed to date. These avaricious, reckless humans if you may will do anything from running a red light to turning a two-way roadway into a one-way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am starting to believe that their vehicles couldn't have had a better colour license plate because nothing screams danger more than a taxi man trying to meet a quota.
        Something tells me that as the years go by, the emergence of more and more taxis will make the streets virtually "undriveable" to the average Joe and Jane.
        In response to this (and I have been observing this already) an increasing number of "white-plate" drivers will follow in the footsteps of the streets' number one enemy
        out of realization that these actions can go unpunished.
